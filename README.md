jQuery Image Cube
=============

This plugin sets a division to rotate between images (or other things) as if they were on the faces of a cube.

* Random rotations or specific directions.
* Automatic rotation or rotate on command.

Have a look at the plugin Web site, http://keith-wood.name/imageCube.html, for demonstrations of its abilities.

For documentation on the functionality see http://keith-wood.name/imageCubeRef.html.
